### What does fox do?

- Makes is trivial to install a package form a GitHub repository even if it's private. Fox packages are just GitHub
  releases, as long as you have read access to a repo, you can install (pretty much) anything you want.
- Fox installs packages to a specific directory `/usr/local/bin/Fox/bin` (on macOS and linux systems). It won't install
  anything outside that directory.
- Trivially create your own packages. To add your repo to the available packages list, all you need to do is edit a
  **yaml** file. That's it!

### What fox does NOT do?

- Requires you te learn a whole new set of [made up words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWERB5GNExY) to use.
- Run post-install scripts that may do something nasty to your machine.

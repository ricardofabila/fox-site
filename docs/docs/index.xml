Fox packages are just GitHub releases, as long as you have read access to a repo, you can install (pretty much) anything you want. Fox installs packages to a specific directory /usr/local/bin/Fox/bin (on macOS and linux systems). It won&amp;rsquo;t install anything outside that directory. Trivially create your own packages. To add your repo to the available packages list, all you need to do is edit a yaml file.</description></item><item><title>âš¡ Quick Start</title><link>https://www.getfox.sh/docs/docs/quick-start/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2020 13:59:39 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.getfox.sh/docs/docs/quick-start/</guid><description>Dependencies: # âš“ Required # This tool is as zero-dependencies as it can possibly get.
GitHub CLI to install packages. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if you don&amp;rsquo;t have it already, just follow the installation instructions below; you can run fox gh to install it ðŸ˜‰. That&amp;rsquo;s it. Seriously, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to install anything more.
Why the GitHub CLI? In order to install packages from private repos, you need to have an access token.</description></item></channel></rss>
